# Release Highlights of PlatEMO 2.0
* __Lighter framework.__ The architecture of PlatEMO is simplified, which leads to lower learning cost and higher efficiency. The result file size is also reduced.  
* __Higher efficiency.__ The runtime of Pareto dominance based algorithms is reduced by using a more efficient non-dominated sorting algorithm. The runtime of decomposition based algorithms is reduced due to the new architecture of PlatEMO. The runtime of hypervolume calculation is reduced by new logic and GPU acceleration. In experimental module, the algorithms can be executed in parallel.  
* __More conveniences.__ The populations obtained during the evolutionary process can be saved in result files. The references of each algorithm, problem, operator, and metric are given in the comments of the function. The codes of GUI are now open source.

# Features of PlatEMO
*  Totally Developed in MATLAB  
PlatEMO consists of a number of MATLAB functions without using any other libraries. Any machines able to run MATLAB can use PlatEMO regardless of the operating system.  

*  Includes Many Popular Algorithms  
PlatEMO includes more than ninety existing popular MOEAs, including genetic algorithm, differential evolution, particle swarm optimization, memetic algorithm, estimation of distribution algorithm, and surrogate model based algorithm. Most of them are representative algorithms published in top journals after 2010.  

*  Various Figure Demonstrations  
Users can select various figures to be displayed, including the Pareto front of the result, the Pareto set of the result, the true Pareto front, and the evolutionary trajectories of any performance indicator values.  

*  Powerful and Friendly GUI  
PlatEMO provides a powerful and friendly GUI, where users can configure all the settings and perform experiments in parallel via the GUI without writing any code.  

*  Generates Data in the Format of Excel or LaTeX  
Users can save the statistical experimental results generated by PlatEMO as an Excel table or LaTeX table, which can be directly used in academic writings.  

# Support  
* [**recommend**] You can ask any question in [issues block](https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO/issues) and upload your contribution by pulling request(PR).
