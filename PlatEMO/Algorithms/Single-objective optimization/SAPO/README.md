# SAPO
[A Surrogate-assisted Partial Optimization for Expensive Constrained Optimization Problems](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-70068-2_24)

- This is an open-source code of SAPO implemented by MATLAB.

- All codes are our originals and implemented to run on [PlatEMO](https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO/releases).


## How to run

  1. Download all the files of SAPO and [PlatEMO](https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO/releases).
  
  1. Add the SAPO directory in this repository to the `Algorithms/Single-objective optimization` directory.

  1. Run `platemo.m` and select SAPO. See the documents of PlatEMO for more details.
