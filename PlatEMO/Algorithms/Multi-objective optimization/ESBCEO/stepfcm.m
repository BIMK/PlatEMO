function [U_new, center, obj_fcn] = stepfcm(data, U, cluster_n, expo)
%STEPFCM One step in fuzzy c-mean clustering.
%   [U_NEW, CENTER, ERR] = STEPFCM(DATA, U, CLUSTER_N, EXPO)
%   performs one iteration of fuzzy c-mean clustering, where
%
%   DATA: matrix of data to be clustered. (Each row is a data point.)
%   U: partition matrix. (U(i,j) is the MF value of data j in cluster j.)
%   CLUSTER_N: number of clusters.
%   EXPO: exponent (> 1) for the partition matrix.
%   U_NEW: new partition matrix.
%   CENTER: center of clusters. (Each row is a center.)
%   ERR: objective function for partition U.
%
%   Note that the situation of "singularity" (one of the data points is
%   exactly the same as one of the cluster centers) is not checked.
%   However, it hardly occurs in practice.
