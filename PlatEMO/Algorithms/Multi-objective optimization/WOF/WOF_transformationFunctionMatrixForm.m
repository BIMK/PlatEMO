function value = WOF_transformationFunctionMatrixForm(xPrime,weight,maxVal,minVal,method)
% Implements the transformation functions used in WOF. Three 
% methods can be chosen. The p-Value and Multiplication-transformations
% have been introduced in publication (3), see the WOF.m main file. 
% The Intervall-transformation (parameter free) has been introduced in 
% publication (2), see above. The interval-intersection method from (3)
% is currently not implemented.
